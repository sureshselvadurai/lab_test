Fill in code in the GameServer and GameClient so that clients could play a number guessing game:
The server generates a random number from 0 to 10, the client tries to guess it,
while the server provides the hints:

This is a sample output from the client side:

Client: Started...
Server: I guessed a number from 0 to 10, guess it:
4
Server: Your guess is too low
7
Server: Your guess is too high
5
Server: Your guess is too low
6
Server: Correct guess! Game over.
---------------------------------

You should be using sockets for the server and the client, and each client should be handled by a different Runnable.
